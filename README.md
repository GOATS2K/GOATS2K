### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 21 year old from Oslo, Norway studying Computer Science at De Montfort University in Leicester, UK.

When I'm not studying, I work for [SuperOffice AS](https://superoffice.com) as a full-stack .NET developer.

My most recent project is Overpass, a self-hosted video live streaming service. I haven't worked on it much lately, but that is about to change.
Thanks to [everyone from HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29572310) for stopping by!

Oh, and I also produce, mix and master Drum & Bass music under the alias [Closure](https://soundcloud.com/closurednb).

Feel free to email me on `initials@lastname.com` if you would like to chat! ðŸ˜„
